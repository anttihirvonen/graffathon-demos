Sources for all demos released at Graffathon (http://graffathon.fi)

To run, donwload Processing 2.1+ and open the main .pde-file (can be found as `./<production_name>/<name>/<name>.pde`, where `<name>` is a subdir inside demo's directory). Some demos require <a href="http://graffathon.fi/downloads/moonlander">Moonlander</a> and/or <a href="http://toxiclibs.org/">Toxiclibs</a> in addition to standard Processing libraries. After you've installed those, all demos should work (at least they did during the compo :).

Credits and some info for each demo can be found inside README.txt-files (in Finnish).
