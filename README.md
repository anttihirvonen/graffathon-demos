**This repository contains sources for all demos released at Graffathon 2014 (http://graffathon.fi).**

See [voting sesults](http://www.graffathon.fi/downloads/results.txt) for the final order in the competition.

If you want to run the demos on your own machine, do the following:

1. Download [Processing](http://processing.org/download/) 2.2.1+
2. Download and install [Moonlander](http://graffathon.fi/downloads/Moonlander) (some demos require it)
3. Download and install [Toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/) (some demos require it)

This process shouldn't take you longer than 5 minutes. After that, choose a demo and open it's main .pde-file in Processing. The main file is located at `./<production_and_group_name>/<name>/<name>.pde`, where `<name>` is a subdir inside demo's directory. Click the run button and demo should start!

If you encounter any problems, please open an issue â€“ we want to keep these demos runnable as long as possible.

Credits and some other info for each demo can be found inside README.txt-files (in Finnish).
